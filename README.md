## About the project

This project unifies everything learned so far. We will develop a routes app (mobile first) where users will register, login, view routes and can save routes to their favourites. All this Using the API we will recieve from the good people on the data science course. 

## Requirements
Once the needs of the project have been analyzed, it is expected
that the students develop a frontend & backend that is capable of the following:
● User registration.
● User login.
● You can see the routes, comment and rate teh different routes.
● You can save routes in favourites.
● Questionaire to gather data.
● Profile page where users can edit their profile.
● Use of branches with git, when the project is finished there should be two branches, the master or main and the develop.
● Excellent README presentation.

 ## Source

![TheBridge](./toReadme/thebridgelogo.svg)

The project originates from the FullStack bootcamp at [TheBridge](https://www.thebridge.tech/), It is the final project of the Bootcamp simulating a real life project where you are part of a team working on one project. We need to create both frontend & backend, thus achieving a Full-Stack project. The main objective is to create a functional routes app, using React Redux in the frontend and MongoDB and Mongoose in the backend.

## Challenges presented

This was an incredibly difficult project, given that we did not know about React a few weeks ago. It has been a steep learning curve. In little more than a week we have created a backend and frontend mobile first app. There has been many challenges along the way, but I am still motivated to continue learning and gettting better.  


## Things we would have liked to have added

- Back: Testing (jest) 

- Front: Testing (cypres?) (extra)

## Acknowledgment

We would like to thank our mentor [Germán](https://github.com/GeerDev) for teaching us React just a few weeks ago and for his pacience with us. We would also like to thank all of our classmates from the Bootcamp for always being there to help us resolve problems or simply to give some constructive critism.
